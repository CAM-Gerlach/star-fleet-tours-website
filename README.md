*Copyright Â© 2019-2021 Star Fleet Tours*

This repo is the source for the Star Fleet Tours [website](https://www.star-fleet.tours/).
It is built using [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/), previewed via Netlify, deployed via Github Actions CI, served by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and hosted on a custom domain.

Created and maintained by [C.A.M. Gerlach](https://github.com/CAM-Gerlach), [Steven Giraldo](https://github.com/Stevengrm) and [Evan Courey](https://github.com/EvanDotPro), the founders and organizers of Star Fleet Tours, with invaluable help from the Star Fleet community.
Enjoy!



## Usage

You can view it live on the web, built by Github Actions in real-time from the latest version of the theme, at the link in the repo description, or build it locally by cloning the repo ``lektor-icon`` repo and running ``lektor server`` in the ``star-fleet-tours-website`` directory (ensure you're using a version of Lektor >=3.1 for theme support).
The theme has full support for configuration either via the ``contents.lr`` source files, or the Lektor web GUI.

## Launch countdown override

The landing page and the tickets page can both display a countdown to an upcoming launch. This defaults to automatically retrieving and display the next SpaceX launch from Florida as appropriate. If you need to do something different, edit `assets/static/js/custom-scripts.js` to specify a `missionOverride`:

```javascript
const missionOverride = {
    missionName: "Spacecow",
    launchAt: 1234567890 // the UNIX timestamp of the projected T-0 time
};
```

The countdowns display only if the mission is in the near future. To prevent countdown display entirely, specify a mission override with `launchAt: 0`.
