Join Star Fleet for the next flight of the Crew Dragon, the world's first and only operational commercial crew capsule!
It'll be be launching on **Thursday, January 18 at 4:49 PM EST** (22:11 UTC) with the Ax-3 mission for Axiom Space, carrying a spaceflight veteran and three private astronauts, including the first-ever spaceflight of a Turkish citizen and the first commercially-flown ESA astronaut.
Weather- and demand-permitting, Star Fleet plans to go out for both the launch itself, and boat trip to see the rocket up close on the pad the day prior.

This launch will feature a spectacular Return to Launch Site booster landing, and we'll be in an ideal position to view it.
Our current nominal planned viewing location provide the closest and clearest view of the booster landing available anywhere.
It has a clear view of both pads all the way down to the landing legs, and is around or less than 4 mi / 6 km from the landing trajectory as the booster lights its engines and arcs in almost right over our heads, and around or less than 6 mi / ≈9 km from the landing pad itself.
Distance from the launch pad is around 12 mi / 19 km, also with a clear view and a more favorable angle to the trajectory than most land-based spots, at a closest approach of around 9 mi / 14 km.
Note that depending on the exact position of the hazard zones and subject to range and USCG clearance, we may be able to get up to several miles closer to both launch and landing, or may have to be further back if safety and weather conditions dictate.

**LATEST LAUNCH UPDATE**: As we've announced on social media and by email to all booked passengers, the launch was delayed one day to 4:49 PM Thursday, January 18.
All existing reservations continue to be valid for the new date, and passengers may request a full refund if they are no longer able to make the new launch window.
For those who haven't booked yet but would like to, please text or call the Star Fleet number, 321-209-2224, and we'll notify you if and when we're able to add additional capacity or spots open up.
Thanks!
