As of January 7, the SpaceX In Flight Abort test launch of the Crew Dragon capsule for NASA is scheduled for **No Earlier Than Saturday, January 18 at 8:00 AM EST / 13:00 UTC** from historic launch pad LC-39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
This unique experimental launch will feature a planned low-altitude flight termination and subsequent explosion of a re-used Falcon 9 booster, the crew capsule's dramatic escape from the resulting conflagration on its powerful abort engines, and its subsequent parachute landing into the ocean. Star✦Fleet will offer the closest, clearest and best-angle view of these historic events, better than any land-based location, and

This mission we'll only have the small, ocean-capable boats available which cost much more per person and either require a deposit or the full trip cost if the launch is delayed with less than 4 days to go since they lose out on business, but they allow us to get much closer to the action, closer than anywhere on land and with the best seats in the house. As such, the cost is a good deal higher than a normal mission, $95 per person (but that's valid for both TNT1 and the small boats), but if it does get delayed less than that but before we leave the dock, we'll cover that cost and rebook for you if possible, as well as offer discounted pre-launch tour tickets to people who still want to go out on that day and see the rocket on the pad.

**STATUS UPDATE:** *The third batch of tickets, each larger than the last, has again sold out. However, yet again we are looking into getting more boats; assuming we are able to, they will open up at 12:00 noon EST / 17:00 UTC on Sunday Jan 12, so stay tuned! In the meantime, feel free to sign up for our [waiting list](https://forms.gle/Ha5YtkwZaEptqzt67) and we'll email you when more tickets are available. Thanks!*
